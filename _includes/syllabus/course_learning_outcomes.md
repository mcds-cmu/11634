After completing the MCDS Capstone course sequence (11-634, 11-632, 11-635),  students should be able to:

- Analyze computational data science problems in different application domains and critique solutions to those problems.
- Design, implement and evaluate a software solution (comprising software system(s) and/or machine learning model(s)) on real world datasets at real world scale.
- Organize, present, and report on a real-world data science project in collaboration with other researchers/programmers.

The purpose of 11-634 is to give students a practical introduction to data science project work by providing a framework within which students join a Capstone project team, work on the project through various stages, and participate in regular presentations and discussions with their peers in other teams.
