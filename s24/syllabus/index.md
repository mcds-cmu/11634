# 11-634: Capstone Planning Seminar - Syllabus

## Course Description

{% include syllabus/course_learning_outcomes.md %}

## Time & Location

MW	08:00 AM	- 09:20AM	SH 236

## Course Format

At the beginning of the course, students will submit their information and resume/CV. In the subsequent weeks, students will have access to both live presentations and recorded videos for each of the candidate's projects. Students will then be asked to submit a list of project preferences. The faculty and MCDS Administration will assign teams to projects by matching the project sponsor's and student's preferences. 

Note: If you have proposed a self-identified project (i.e., have spoken to a faculty member, identified a topic, submitted a proposal, and formed a team / will work individually), please contact course staff within the first week. Each team will begin to work on their assigned project and commence weekly meetings with their project mentor. The course then provides several milestones throughout the semester where each team is required to submit a report and, in some cases, present and discuss their and others' work progress.

## Course Assessments

- **Weekly Standups**. Standups are informal sessions for teams to update on their progress, focusing on authenticity rather than polished presentations, allowing for timely support based on current challenges and developments.

- **Weekly Fellow Feedback on Standups**. Each student, as a Fellow, must provide detailed, rubric-guided feedback on a team's weekly standups, submitting at least three substantial comments per week on the presentation slides for evaluation and grading accuracy.

- **Vision Document**. Document the motivation for the project - what problems does the proposed project attempt to solve, and for what data set(s)? What is novel or unique about the proposed approach? How will success be measured? What is the expected impact (business or research value) if the project is successful? The Vision Document should clearly state Research Questions, General Hypotheses, and Specific (Testable) Hypotheses, along with an indication of how technical performance and/or business value will be measured.

- **Requirements Document**. Document specific use cases (workflows and/or data flows) for the proposed solution. Analyze the data set(s) and provide a domain analysis that identifies the salient characteristics of the data domain and likely challenges (missing data, noise, skewed distributions, magnitude, drift, etc.). Identify (from a systems perspective) what computations will be required to clean, pre-process, prepare, and train models on the data set(s); what software modules must be designed and implemented, either from scratch or using existing toolkits; what metrics and measurement routines must be implemented or deployed using existing toolkits; user/case studies that will be undertaken to demonstrate business value; etc.

- **Design and Plan Document**. Document a specific architecture (modules and data flow) to represent the cleaning pre-processing, model training, solution deployment, and solution evaluation phases for the proposed project. Provide a mapping from each use case in the requirements document to the workflows and modules that will support that use case. Identify which elements will be designed and coded by hand, implemented via existing frameworks / toolkits, or reused from existing solutions. Create a work breakdown structure to indicate what development activities will be undertaken and, at what times, by which team members. It should be clear from the plan how and when each element will be completed, how it will be evaluated, and how error analysis and refinement will be undertaken for each module, as well as the entire end-to-end solution. Teams are strongly encouraged to complete a preliminary end-to-end implementation of each workflow in the solution, along with a corresponding error analysis, before the end of the semester. Preliminary results by mid-semester will be expected for any team that wishes to publish results at the end of the Spring semester.

- **Midterm Presentation**. Present the highlights of the vision, requirements, design, and plan, along with any preliminary results, in a recorded video.

- **Midterm Presentation Peer Review**. Attend at least one peer team's midterm presentation video and submit a brief review of the team(s) 's presentation on Persuall. 

- **Draft Report**. Document all of the updates made to the vision / requirements / design and plan documents, with a focus on any remaining issues to be addressed in the Fall semester. Be sure to revisit the work breakdown structure in order to provide the most realistic plan possible for the remaining work. Summarize all experimental results achieved so far (with appropriate calculations of statistical significance), along with a discussion of performance gains versus the prior state of the art, an analysis of known remaining error types, and suggestions for how to address known gaps in performance or specific error categories.

- **Draft Report Revision (Optional)**. After reviewing feedback for the draft, you will have the opportunity to revise the draft and submission a revision of the draft for regrading. This is optional, but we encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity to learn from the feedback and produce a better version of the draft.

  To be eligible for the revision draft submission, your initial draft report submission must receive at least a grade of 70%, AND your designated TA must recommend you. This means that the original draft you submit must be of substantial and authentic work and that the revised version would be a revised version of the draft report and not used as a time extension mechanism.

  If you submit the revision, your grade for the draft report will be the grade of the revised draft. If you choose not to submit a revision, your grade will be the original grade of the first draft report submission. We strive to give you feedback as quickly as possible to give you sufficient time to review and revise the draft.

- **Spring Final Presentation**. Present your vision, requirements, design, and plan in a short presentation, along with a summary of results so far and work remaining to be completed. The presentations will take place in a public venue; all members of the SCS community (as well as MCDS alumni) and the project mentors will be invited to attend.

- **Final Presentation Peer Review**. Each student is required to attend at least one Spring final presentation of another team and submit a brief review of this team's presentation. Students will have the chance to submit their preference for the team to review according to their schedule suitability.

- ### End-of-Semester Internal Evaluation

To facilitate a fair distribution of work among team members, our assessment process includes a peer review component, conducted exclusively at the end of the semester. This peer review is an individual assignment, integral to the final assessment, focusing on three key aspects:

**Your Contribution to the Project:** Detailing the roles and responsibilities you undertook and your direct impact on the project's progress.

**Peers’ Contribution to the Project:** Providing insights into each team member's contributions. Despite the potential challenge in larger teams, it’s vital to acknowledge and reflect on every member’s involvement.

**Contribution to Peer Learning:** Assessing how you and your peers have facilitated each other's learning throughout the project.

To ensure a meaningful review, you are required to provide substantive, reflective answers to each question. Your responses should include specific examples and constructive criticism aimed at problem-solving and improvement.

The quality of your feedback is a significant component of your grade. Effective feedback benefits both the giver and the receiver, fostering a deeper understanding and improvement. As such, thoughtful and considerate responses are encouraged.

Your review, which will be shared with all team members, should be constructive, respectful, and considerate.

Furthermore, anonymized data from these peer reviews will be made available to all students. This initiative aims to provide insights into team dynamics and encourage discussions on collaborative improvement.

Participation in this peer review is mandatory, and it will substantially influence your individual grade. This policy underscores our commitment to fostering a collaborative learning environment where every member's contribution is valued and assessed fairly.

- **Individual Growth**. Each student is required to define and communicate their personal learning objectives, which they aim to achieve throughout the capstone experience. Additionally, they are to compose a short report that demonstrates their reflective thinking and ongoing efforts towards self-improvement and skill enhancement. This concise report should detail how their experiences in the capstone project have contributed to meeting these learning goals.

- **Final Report**. Submit an update to your Draft Report, which incorporates: a) feedback received on your Draft Report submission and b) feedback received during your Spring Final Presentation.

## Course Schedule

See the [Course Calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.subpath }}{% link s24/schedule.md %}) for the tentative schedule. Specific deadlines are posted on Canvas.

## Weekly Fellow Feedback on Standups

Each student will be assigned as a Fellow to a team, with the responsibility of providing feedback on their weekly standups.
To complete the Weekly Standup Fellow Feedback process:

- Access the Standups Evaluation Rubric: This can be found on Canvas, where you'll get the guidelines for evaluating the presentations.

- Attend and Comment on the Presentation on Persuall: Watch the team's standup presentation and leave comments on their presentation slides. Use the provided rubric as a guide for your feedback. Note that assigning a score to the team is not required.

- Provide Detailed Feedback: Each week, you are expected to submit a minimum of three high-quality comments. Each comment should be well thought out and detailed, ranging from 50-100 words. It's important to distribute your comments evenly throughout the presentation. Your feedback will be assessed using Persuall's quality algorithm, and there will be a manual inspection after the deadline to ensure grading accuracy.

## Grading

Grading will consist of:

**Capstone Project Deliverables**

- Weekly Standups:	5%
- Weekly Fellow Feedback on Standups:	5%
- Vision Document:	10%
- Requirements Document:	10%
- Design Document:	5%
- Plan Document:	5%
- Midterm Presentation:	5%
- Draft Report:	5%
- Final Report:	15%
- Spring Final Presentation:	20%
- End-of-Semester Internal Evaluation:	5%
- Individual Growth:	10%

Deliverables will be assigned a team grade, and it is essential that all members of a team make efforts to collaborate effectively. Above or below-average individual work may put individual grades ahead or below the group grade only by a small margin. We expect everyone not to isolate themselves and make a good faith effort on a regular basis to coordinate/engage with their teammates, share their insights, and make sure everyone can contribute. Individuals will be assigned project grades based on the team grade and peer evaluations.

## Grade Policy

**Individual Grade Adjustments**

In our team-based academic settings, it is recognized that uniform grading may not always reflect individual contributions. Hence, instructors have the discretion to modify a student's grade relative to the team's collective grade. This adjustment is grounded in a thorough evaluation of various factors such as the student's effort, active participation in course work, professionalism, ability to work collaboratively, and demonstration of a growth mindset.

**Grading Methodology**
*Score Normalization:* Our grading process begins with the normalization of scores using statistical techniques. This approach reshapes the distribution of scores into a bell curve format. Instructors then anchor the median score with a specific grade. The grades for other scores are determined based on their relative position to this median.
*Score Distribution Analysis:* Following normalization, instructors analyze the distribution of scores. They identify distinct clusters and breaks in the score distribution, utilizing these gaps as benchmarks for grade assignment.

**Exceptional Performance Recognition**
We reserve the highest accolade, the 'A+' grade, for students who not only secure top marks but also demonstrate significant research impact. This decision is made collectively by course instructors and mentors, ensuring a fair and comprehensive assessment of each student's academic prowess.

## Attendance Policy

Attendance at all class meetings is mandatory. Our class sessions are specifically designed for lectures, in-class standups, and presentations. Experience from previous cohorts strongly indicates that regular attendance is crucial for both the success of the team and the individual growth of each student. Therefore, each student is expected to attend every session as scheduled.

In recognition of the unpredictable nature of circumstances, each student will be allowed **one** absence per semester. This absence is permissible only for sessions where the student's team is not scheduled to present. It should be noted that interview appointments or similar commitments are not considered valid reasons for additional absences beyond this single allowance.

## Academic Integrity

For all team presentations and the final report, it's imperative that students present their work in a manner that distinctly outlines their contributions and differentiates them from existing work. This includes clearly indicating parts of the project that have been influenced by, derived from, or adapted from prior works. It is crucial that these external influences are not only acknowledged but also properly cited in both the report and presentation slides.

Appropriate citation must cover a wide range of materials, including but not limited to:

- Academic writings (including those published by collaborators of the project)
- Diagrams and visual aids
- Datasets utilized in the project
- Reports from previous Capstone projects
- Video tutorials and scientific blog posts
- Technical components such as algorithms, software libraries, and similar tools
- When incorporating these materials into your work, two key principles must be followed:

Paraphrasing: When the text from a source is paraphrased (i.e., rewritten in your own words), it is essential to cite the original source to acknowledge its influence on your work.
Direct Quotation: If a piece of text is used verbatim (exactly as it appears in the source), it must be placed within quotation marks and accompanied by a specific reference to its origin.
Ensuring the integrity of your work through proper citations is not only a scholarly requirement but also a mark of respect for the intellectual property of others. This practice is central to upholding academic honesty and fostering a culture of responsibility and ethical scholarship in our academic community.

## Assignment Submission Confidentiality and Use for Course Improvement

All assignment submissions for this course will be utilized for course analytics and to enhance future course offerings. These submissions will remain confidential and will not be made publicly available, unless express written consent is provided by at least one of the authors of the submitted work.
